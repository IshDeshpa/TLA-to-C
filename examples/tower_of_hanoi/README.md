# Tower of Hanoi
Two specification variants of the ["Tower of Hanoi" problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi):
* `Hanoi.tla` The towers are modeled as natural numbers and module overwrites are demonstrated. The number of disk and towers defined by the model. Please see [issue #9](https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples/issues/9) for shortcomings of this spec.
* `HanoiSeq.tla` The towers are modeled as three sequences of integers.
